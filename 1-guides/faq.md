## How can I disable AI completion?

If you type `for ` and your text editor shows a complete `for` loop, this is generated by AI and you have to disable it.

On PyCharm, disable AI code completion by visiting the Preferences (`Cmd-,` i.e. Command + comma, on macOS), searching for completion on the top left search bar, and unchecking these two boxes:

- under "Code completion", disable "Sort completion suggestions based on machine learning"

- under "Inline completion", disable "Enable local Full Line completion suggestions"

On VSCode, click on `Hide copilot` from the menu.

Test the new settings by typing the start of a for loop with `for `:

- if you don't see any code, you have disabled AI completion

- if you see a full line of code, you still need to disable AI completion

Please ask us for any help in this regard.
