# Nameplate

The official CBS nameplate is required for me to take attendance.

If you don't have an official nameplate:

- install the [Aptos font from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=106087) on your system (on macOS, you download the ZIP file, extract, enter the folder, and double-click on `Aptos.ttf`)

- download the template on Canvas files, titled `nameplate.docx` ([link]())

- print and cut the document to be the same size as an actual nameplate

This is your best chance that the computer vision algorithm recognize your nameplate. Even so, it is not guaranteed to work; only official CBS nameplates are guaranteed to work.
