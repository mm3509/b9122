# Exam reminder for students

Dear Students,

This message contains important reminders about the exam which takes place on Wednesday, October 15th:

- MSFE + Engineering students: Geffen 620, 2-5pm;

- MSAFA + MSM: Geffen 590, 2.20-5.20pm.

If you are registered for accommodations and received a different room assignment and a different schedule, proceed to that room at that time.

The exam is open-book and open-notes; you can use the internet and StackOverflow.

## Is the exam proctored?

Yes, CBS uses a remote proctoring software called Proctorio. During an exam, Proctorio collects student activity in four ways: 1) Video Recording, 2) Audio Recording, 3) Recording user's computer screen, and 4) Recording user's web traffic.

You are required to use Proctorio for the whole duration of the exam (3 hours; penalty: 1x the number of seconds disconnected from Proctorio).

You should take the Proctorio test exam (found in the Quizzes tab in Canvas) before the exam so your device is ready to go before exam day.

Read the [Exam Readiness & Requirements page](https://business.columbia.edu/samberg/cbs-classroom/exam-readiness-requirements) and follow the instructions to download Proctorio and troubleshoot any technical issues.

## How much time do I have to take the exam?

The duration is 3 hours (unless you qualify for accommodations).

## Can I wear ear plugs?

Yes, you can.

## What do I do if I experience technical difficulties with my computer or software?

If your problem is with Proctorio, notify us IMMEDIATELY so we know that you are not trying to use AI.

Follow the troubleshooting steps on the [Exam Readiness & Requirements page](https://business.columbia.edu/samberg/cbs-classroom/exam-readiness-requirements).

If the issue persists, please ask us for help.

## What do I need to bring?

- A laptop that is fully charged, where you will write your answers

- A laptop charger

- A backpack to hold everything else, which you will bring to the front of the room before the start of the exam

## What should I do before the exam?

- Install Google Chrome and Proctorio, and take the Proctorio test exam on Canvas (under "Quizzes").

- Change your default search engine to DuckDuckGo or install the DuckDuckGo app. You cannot use Google.

- Disable AI code completion in your text editor.

- Within 24 hours of the exam end time, login to Canvas and check "remember me for 24 hours", so you that you do not have to login again during the exam.

## What should I do on exam day?

### Before the exam start

- Arrive at the room 30 minutes before the exam start.

- Take your assigned seat on the screen (or available on Canvas, in `Files > seating` , 1 hour before the start time); (penalty: 5 points)

- Take out your laptop and charger (and cheat sheets, if any).

- Put your phone on silent mode, and leave everything else inside your backpack (including phones and iPads), then bring the backpack to us at the front of the room. Proctorio cannot monitor these, so we don't want to see them in the exam.

- Within 15 minutes of the exam start time, go to Canvas, click on "Modules" in the left navigation menu, then on "Midterm Exam". This should start Proctorio (penalty: 1x the number of seconds disconnected from Proctorio for the duration of the exam)

- You will need to read and pledge to abide by the exam policies, which are required to access the exam.

- At the exam start time, the exam document and template files will become available.

### During the exam

- Do not use generative AI (penalty: 2x the points in the question).

- Do not cheat.

- Other than logging into Canvas, do not use your phone nor tablet (penalty: 1 point).

- Do not talk to your classmates and do not disrupt the exam (penalty: 1 point).

- During the exam, the Professor and TAs will be in the room to answer your clarification questions or issues with Autograder.

- Near the end of the exam, submit on Gradescope (not on Canvas); if needed, activate a previous submission; we do not allow late submissions and will not activate a previous submission for you.

- Even if you finish early, you cannot leave the room and should leave Proctorio connected to avoid the penalty of disconnection time from Proctorio.
