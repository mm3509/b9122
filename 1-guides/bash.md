# Bash (Bourne-Again Shell)

## Most important bash commands

- `pwd`, **print working directory**: the shell is always at a certain place on your computer, called the working directory (or the current directory, or the current path). This command prints it.

```
$ pwd
/Users/miguel
```

- `cd`, **change directory**: change the current directory to what you pass as an argument, or to the `$HOME` (or `~`) folder if no argument

``` bash
$ cd
$ cd b9122
$ pwd
/Users/miguel/b9122
```

- `ls`, **list files**: list the files and folders of the working directory.

```
$ ls
0-code		2-lectures	4-exams		syllabus
1-guides	3-assignments	README.md
```
