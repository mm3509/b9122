# Introduction

Welcome to B9122!

I am both an academic (with three masters, a PhD from Columbia, and two post-docs) and an entrepreneur in early childhood education (see [here](www.surfeel.org)). I am passionate about education and learning and I will do my utmost for this course to be a *significant learning experience* for you.

I love coding, solving problems with immediate feedback from the computer, and I often enter a "state of flow" when I code (known as programmer's high). I prepared the assignments and exams for you to also experience that state, which I believe is the best way to learn coding (even if it is sometimes frustrating to "play chess with the computer"). The lectures will prepare you for the assignments, which will prepare you for both interviews and exams. You will succeed in this course when you can solve problems in assessments or interviews without external help.

You can expect me to always be kind, courteous, fair, consistent, and transparent. You can hold me accountable to those standards and please flag to me if you believe I am not honoring them.

Please contact me if you have any questions about this document, my policies, or the grading standards.

E-mail: please use Canvas Discussions, or see my email on Canvas.

For TA information, please see Courseworks (because this repository is public).

I distribute course material on this Github repository (for material that is plain-text) or on Canvas (for PDFs of lecture slides, announcements, handouts, and exams). You can ask questions after class or on Canvas "Discussions"; if you don't feel comfortable that your colleagues see your question, you can email me (but I respond much faster on Canvas than by email). You should make sure that you receive announcements and messaging notifications.

We welcome students from all divisions and departments, contingent on availability. Business school students will have priority when registering.

# Basic and advanced tracks

This course has two tracks, for two sets of students:

- a **basic** track (section 2) for MSAFA (Masters of Science in Accounting and Fundamental Analysis), and MSM (Masters of Science in Marketing) students;

- an **advanced** track (section 1) for MSFE (Masters of Science in Finance and Economics), Engineering, and PhD students.

# Schedule of lectures and exams

__Lectures__: Wednesdays 9am-12.15pm (section 1, advanced, Geffen 620); Wednesdays 2.20pm-5.35pm (section 2, basic, Geffen 590)

__Waiver exam__: August 29th, 2-5pm, Kravis 870 (see below for details)

__Midterm exam__: October 13th, 2-5pm.

__Final exam__: December 10th, 2-5pm.

# Course Description

This course prepares students to bridge the gap between:

- Computer programming and software engineering, for example, "write a computer program that sorts a vector of integers".

- Statistics, regression models, and computational analytics, for example "create a model that predicts a stock price".

This bridge will be useful in conducting research and other work. This work often involves tasks such as:

- Data: gathering, organizing, and cleaning ("ETL", Extract-Transform-Load);

- Analysis: numerical algorithms (e.g., regression, simulation, optimization, etc.);

- Results: generating and presenting them.

The first half of the course, until and including the midterm, focuses on programming and software engineering. The second half of the course, from after the midterm until the final, will focus on data analysis.

# Policies

The course, policies, and grading run like code: this syllabus is the software and I am the hardware (or compiler, or interpreter), merely executing the rules in this syllabus. This section is a summary of policies; if you are interested in all the details, corner cases, and rationale, please check the appendices on this same directory (`appendix-academic-integrity.md`, `appendix-exam.md`, `appendix-grading.md`, and `appendix-policies.md`).

- I expect you to be Present, Prepared, and Participating (CBS Core Culture).

- I expect you to be engaged with the material, and to demonstrate courtesy and respect in class.

- In-class attendance is mandatory and counts towards your grade.

- In the grading, attendance is capped at 9 lectures, assignments at 4, and online participation at 85%. These "freebies" are not permission to skip class; instead they are my "insurance policy" to avoid dealing with emails and corner cases.

- Excused absences follow school policy; all other absences are not excused (but can come from your freebies)

- Generative AI is strictly forbidden.

- Academic integrity rules are very strict.

- I will investigate every suspected case of generative AI or academic dishonesty.

- Late submissions will earn a null grade.

- We enter a "blackout period" 24 hours before the deadline of an assignment or exam, when the TAs and I no longer answer questions.

## Course waiver

You can waive the class if you complete a waiver exam and get a grade above percentile 90 of last year's final exam grade. The grading standards that apply to this assignment are those of the final exam; in particular, you will not be able to use ANY AI tools (chatbot, AI code completion, AI answers in an online search). I will explain this in detail at the start of the exam.

Anyone can take the waiver exam. You can simply come with a computer to Kravis 870 on Friday, August 29th from 2 PM – 5 PM EDT, and take the exam.

To succeed in the waiver exam, you need a basic level in Bash, C and SQL, and an intermediate level in Python (imperative programming and control flow, basic data structures, recursive programming, object-oriented programming, debugging).

## Grading

The weights for the final numeric grade are below. Please see `appendix-grading.md` for the detailed rubrics in grading each component and for the conversion to a letter grade.

| **Weight** | **Component**                                   |
