# Appendix: Policies, Classroom Norms, and Expectations

## Core Culture

Students are expected to adhere to [CBS Core Culture](https://business.columbia.edu/samberg/cbs-classroom/academic-policies/cbs-core-culture) in this class by being Present, Prepared, and Participating.

## Inclusion, Accommodation, and Support for Students

At Columbia Business School we believe diversity strengthens any community or business model and brings it greater success. The School is committed to providing all students with equal opportunity to thrive in the classroom by providing a learning, living, and working environment free from discrimination, harassment, and bias on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or ability.

Students with documented disabilities may receive reasonable accommodations. Students are encouraged to contact [Columbia University's Office of Disability Services](https://www.health.columbia.edu/content/disability-services) for information and to register for services.

Columbia Business School adheres to all community, state, and federal regulations as relate to Title IX and student safety.

## Attendance is mandatory

In-person attendance to the course is **mandatory** for three reasons:

- If you don't attend in-person, you may fall behind with the material and never recover;

- I need to get a sense of your abilities and progress;

- I want immediate feedback on my teaching and on the material, so I can improve both the course and myself.

I take attendance twice per lecture, in the first 5 minutes of each half-lecture. You can attend lectures on Echo360, but these will count zero towards your grade.

I will take attendance exactly 5 minutes after the start of class, e.g. when the clock turns from 9:04 to 9:05 if the class starts at 9am. I will publish a seating assignment (which will change twice during the term, after lecture 5 and after lecture 9). You will need your nameplate and to take your assigned seat, otherwise my attendance software will not recognize your attendance. If you do both and do not receive confirmation of attendance, I may have a bug in the software, so please contact me for it.

I take attendance with a picture of the class; you will need to take your assigned seat and hold your nameplate clearly visible in front of you. If you do not have your nameplate, or you didn't take your assigned seat, your attendance will not count.

I want to start and end every class on time. You can hold me accountable to that.

Please see the grading rubric on class participation regarding eating in class, leaving during the class, use of laptops, cell phones, or other devices.

## Freebies

Except for exams, each component of grading has a "freebie" allowance, or a margin of tolerance. For example, lecture attendance is capped at 9 lectures (or 18 half-lectures) out of 11 lectures (the first lecture, before add-drop does not count). This freebie allowance is not permission for you to skip lecture; instead, it is my insurance policy to avoid dealing with emails requesting excuses for corner cases, such as "I am very sick, but not so sick as to go to the doctor" or "I forgot my nameplate, can you mark me as present?"

You are better off if you do not count on using these freebies, for example if you skip two lectures during interview season and at the end of term you are invited to a recruiting weekend and miss lecture, you will lose points.

Your freebie allowance consists of:

- 2 lectures, of 4 half-lectures;

- 15% for online polls, online quizzes, and end-of-lecture submissions;

- 1 assignment (I drop the lowest grade).

## Excused absences

I understand conflicts arise. Below is a list of absences that I consider excused and for which I will grant full lecture attendance or a 1-day extension to an assignment. I will require documentation such as a letter indicating dates of illness from a medical professional, legal summons, etc.

Excused abse

- Religious observance,

- Military Service,

- Court appearance,

- Illness,

- Family emergencies, such as death or serious illness of immediate family member.

Absences are only excused in the cases listed above and students must provide notification in advance of absence from class.

The School is in discussions about where this policy is heading (e.g., requiring an absence request form). In the meantime, please send your request for an excused absence to me by email.

## Non-excused absences

Absences will not be excused for interviews, illness or sickness without justification, class conflicts, recruiting, weddings, student activities, conferences, competitions, travel,  etc.

In these cases, your absence to lecture will make you lose attendance points and you will have to submit your assignments by the deadline.

## Generative AI is forbidden

After this course, generative AI will be a substantial aid to your learning. For example, you could write code in Python, have generative AI convert it to VBA, and read it to confirm it is correct.

Nevertheless, during this course, **I do not allow generative AI under any capacity or circumstance**.

The rationale for this is two-fold:

- A company will not allow you to use generative AI in an interview: anyone can copy-paste the instructions from a problem and copy back the answer.

- At this stage, generative AI is a substitute and not a complement to your learning. I have seen many students use code suggestions from generative AI without understanding them, but hoping it would fix a problem they don't want to deal with.

I want you to develop solid foundations in coding: "you learn to walk before you can run." After "learning to walk" in this course, you'll be able to "run" and be more productive thanks to generative AI.

If, over the course of an investigation (see below) I conclude that you cannot reproduce the code you submitted (for example by using generative AI), you will immediately lose **twice the points** in the question.

The following is a list of disallowed uses of generative AI:

- You cannot use generative AI to complete your assignment, get ideas on your code, or refactor your code;

- You cannot use AI code completion in PyCharm, VS Code; if you decide to use these programs, you are responsible for deactivating AI code completion, but I strongly encourage you to instead use Emacs instead, along with my coding snippets, which will save you a lot of time;

- You cannot use AI code completion on Replit.com;

- You cannot use Google Search because of the "AI search labs overview"; instead, you must use the DuckDuckGo search engine.

- You cannot use generative AI to generate a "cheat sheet" for your exam.

**You can use non-automatic code completion**, e.g. `M-/` in Emacs.

I expect you to own your code. I mean "own" in two senses: your code is your own, and no-one else's (nor generative AI's); and I will hold you accountable, i.e. I may ask you to come to office hours and rewrite a piece of code from scratch.

I will inspect and investigate each case of suspected violation of this policy.

Some of our methods are:

- exam monitoring with Proctorio, which records your screen;

- automated code similarity to flag submissions that look similar and may both have used generative AI;

- checking the invisible watermarks on text generated by AI;

- a one-on-one time with me to show me how you would write the solution from scratch, to assess if the AI did it for you;

- an inspection of your search history on generative AI to understand what happened.

- referral to the Center for Student Success and Improvement for further investigation.

Even if somehow you escape detection on the assignments, violating this policy will be a recipe for disaster on the exams, where I will ask questions that generative AI cannot solve.

Don't try to outsmart me. If you cheat, the risks you are taking far exceed the benefits. Don't do it.

If you have read this far, let me know by the end of lecture 2 and I'll owe you a beer or a cider.

## Late assignments earn zero grade

Gradescope will not let you submit a late assignment. If you miss a deadline, you will get a zero grade.

## Blackout period

Twenty-four hours before the deadline of assignments or exams, we enter a "blackout" period, where the TAs and I will no longer answer emails or discussions on Canvas.

## In-person exams

All exams, midterm and final, are in-person. I have tried take-home exams in the past and regretted it, for two reasons.

First, the temptation to cheat is too strong to resist. Since you are graded on a curve, and the MS program does not yet have the non-disclosure policy to employers, it's extremely tempting to ask for help to improve the grade. The only cheating problems I had during exams were due to take-home exams; I never had one in an in-person exam. Therefore, I now only do in-person exams.

Second, the combination of a take-home exam and submissions on the Autograder imply that most students will get maximum points on exams. Along with maximum points on assignments and attendance, which are easy to get, it implies that the difference in letter grades comes from small differences in class participation and I got complaints such as "I got 100% on all assignments and exams and attended all lectures, why do I have an A-?"

The guidelines for the in-person exam is so important to me that I wrote the guidelines in a separate document, available below and on Github.

## Review of suspected violations of these policies

If you received an email about your submissions being flagged for possible use of generative AI or similarity to another student, this guide provides some clarity about the process.

Please bear in mind that receiving the email does not mean you did anything wrong. I take academic integrity very seriously, so if I have any doubt about your submission, I will invite you to a meeting to provide a rationale. During this process, you will have an opportunity to explain your actions to myself and perhaps to the Center for Student Success and Intervention (CSSI). In most cases, it will be a routine check due to some unlucky coincidence of two students solving the problem with the same non-trivial logic; if so, the matter will be clear immediately and you will get my feedback to improve your coding process and style. If you did nothing wrong, please rest assured that you will not bear any negative consequences. In both cases, you can count on me to always do what is right.

This is the process:

1. I will ask you to come to Office Hours or schedule a one-to-one meeting with me via [Calendly](https://calendly.com/mm3509-columbia/meeting-with-miguel);

1. I will ask you if you used generative AI, copied from a classmate, or got help from outside the course;

1. I will show you the code that caused suspicion;

1. I will give you an opportunity to explain the situation, if you want to;

1. I will ask you to write the same code from scratch ("live coding"), so I can make an assessment.

If I conclude that you did not violate these policies, I will restore your grade and close the matter.

If I conclude that you violated these policies:

- You will immediately lose **twice the points** in the question.

- I will submit a report to the Student Conduct in CSSI (which is independent of the grade penalty). You will have an opportunity to explain your situation to the student conduct team. They are an impartial team and will explain their process to you should they receive report. You can read more about that process [here](https://cssi.columbia.edu/content/academic-misconduct-faculty-faq).

## No exceptions

There will be no exceptions to these policies.
