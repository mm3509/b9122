# Appendix: In-person exam

You'll have to read and pledge to abide by this policy to gain access to the in-person exam document.

Violating the guidelines in this document is forbidden, violates the [CBS Honor Code](https://students.business.columbia.edu/office-of-student-affairs/academic-advising-and-student-success/academic-integrity), and I will report suspected instances. Please contact me if you have any questions about this policy.

## Before the exam

- Install Proctorio and test it with the Test Exam on Canvas.

- Read the new policies on academic integrity, generative AI, and the in-person exam.

## Before entering the exam room

- Bring a single computer with an internet connection and a charger.

- Give me your phone(s), your tablet(s), external screens and all electronic devices other the computer above at the beginning of class, which I will place in a transparent box. The reason is that Proctorio only monitors one screen, so any other screens you use cannot be monitored.

- Check your place in the random seating arrangement, published two hours before the exam.

## During the exam

- Ask us for help if you need it.

- Submit your solutions to Gradescope (not Canvas) before the deadline. Gradescope will close automatically at the deadline and will not accept late submissions.

## Penalties

- 5 points if you do not take your random seat assignment;

- 5 points if you use your phone, your tablet, or another electronic device during the assignment;

- X points if you don't use Proctorio throughout the exam, where X is 0 if you use Proctorio for more than 2h55min, X is 140 if you use Proctorio for less than 1 hour, and linear in between;

- 140 points if you submit late.

If you did not install Proctorio ahead of time, any time you lose by setting it up on exam day will NOT be made up to you. The assignment submission will automatically close on the deadline.
