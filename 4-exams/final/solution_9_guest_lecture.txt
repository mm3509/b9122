Nicole suggested to consider three parts of the career:

1. in the first part of your career: paying off student loans, building a nest egg, but controlling your spending rate and not getting too attached to having a lof of money;

2. in the second part of your career: finding your "why", a passion, for example by volunteering part-time;

3. in the third part of your career: finding an NGO or a cause that matches your passion, and volunteering with them, as many NGOs and causes will need people with your expertise who can donate their time.
